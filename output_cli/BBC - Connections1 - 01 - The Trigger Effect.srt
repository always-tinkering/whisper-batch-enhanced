1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Ah, cannot do this one a Render fighter.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
APPLAUSE

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Would you do me a favour?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'd like to stop talking for a minute, and when I do,

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
take a look at the room you're in, and above all,

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
at the man-made objects in that room that surround you,

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the television set, the lights, the phone and so on.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And ask yourself, what those objects do to your life,

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
just because they're there? Go ahead.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, that is what this series is going to be all about.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's about the things that surround you in the modern world,

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and just because they're there, shape the way you think and behave.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And why they exist in the form they do, and who or what was responsible for them existing at all.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The search for those clues will take us all over the world,

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and 12,000 years into the past, because it's in those strange places,

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and in those long gone centuries, that the secret of the modern world lies.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you never believe the extraordinary things that led to us being the way we are today.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Things like, for instance, why a 16th century doctor at the Court of Queen Elizabeth

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
did something that made it possible for you to watch this screen now?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Or the fact that because 18th century merchants were worried about ships' bottoms,

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you have nylon to wear.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Or why a group of French monks and their involvement with sheep rearing

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
up to give the modern world the computer.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Or what medieval Europeans did with their fire in winter that led to motor car manufacture.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The story of the events and the people who, over centuries,

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
came together to bring us in from the cold,

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and to wrap us in a warm blanket of technology is a matter of vital importance,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
since more and more of that technology infiltrates every aspect of our lives.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's become a life support system, without which we can't survive.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And yet, how much of it do we understand?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do I bother myself with the reality of what happens when I get into a big steel box,

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
press a button and rise into the sky?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Of course I don't.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
S Henderson.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Well I don't think it'd keep me here last but it'd have to kill the beast because of the

36
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:51,940
I take going up in the world like that for granted. We all do. And as the years of the

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,420
20th century have gone by, the things we take for granted have multiplied way beyond the

38
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,620
ability of any individual to understand in a lifetime. The things around us, the man-made

39
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,380
inventions we provide ourselves with are like a vast network, each part of which is

40
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,300
interdependent with all the others. I mean, cross the road. Whether or not a car coming

41
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,500
around the corner knocks you down. May have something to do with the person you've never

42
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,380
met fitting the brakes correctly. Change anything in that network and the effects spread like

43
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,780
ripples on a pond. And all the things in that network have become so specialised that only

44
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,980
the people involved in making them understand them. I don't mean use them, anybody can use

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,860
them. Down there is one of the biggest, most complex cities in the world, full of people

46
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,740
using things as if they understood them. And sometimes not even knowing they're doing

47
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,820
it. New York City, like all the other major high-density

48
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,020
population centres scattered across the earth, is a technology island. It can either feed

49
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,100
nor close nor house nor warm its inhabitants without supplies from outside. Without those

50
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,140
supplies, the entire massive structure and the teeming millions it encloses would die.

51
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,340
And yet, in cities everywhere, we act as if that were not so. We have no choice. The pace

52
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,180
of life in New York is set by the pace of the technology that serves it. You just have

53
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
to hope it will stay that way.

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,580
I'd like you to meet a few people who were in or near New York City on a November evening

55
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,180
over a decade ago. And the reason I'd like you to meet them is because they all have

56
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,540
one thing in common. They were all brought to a sudden and catastrophic realisation

57
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,820
of how vulnerable they were, how dependent on one aspect of that technological network

58
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,940
I was talking about, because of what this did to their lives. Now, until I was told what

59
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,540
this is, I was no more able to recognise what it is than you are now. But what's what it

60
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,020
did to those people. And if you look very carefully, you'll see evidence of what this

61
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
does in every second of what follows now.

62
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:09,020
It's one minute past five in the evening, rush hour in downtown Manhattan. 800,000 people

63
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,180
crowd onto subways looking forward to hope to the end of this journey. For most of them,

64
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,180
the technology carrying them doesn't exist. They take it for granted.

65
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:32,020
Two minutes past five. Kennedy Airport, the usual evening departure rate, passengers with

66
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,900
appointments in New Delhi, London, Tokyo. Appointments they expect to keep. And 200

67
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,980
planes due to arrive in the next five hours.

68
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:52,100
No delays expected. Three minutes past five. At the energy control centre downtown, nothing

69
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,980
special is happening. It's the standard rush hour condition in the main control room. The

70
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,860
time of day when power consumption started to come up to a maximum as people head for

71
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,180
home and meals get cooked. It's cool outside after a high of 58, the temperature is falling

72
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,020
to an expected low of 39 with a predicted wind chill factor of five degrees. The energy

73
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,020
levels are more than enough to cook, even on a chilly November evening.

74
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,700
Ten past five. Mount Sinai Hospital.

75
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,140
I'm just giving you an option to know how good the cycle is in your way.

76
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,260
The patient, Mrs. Marcanna, is expecting twins.

77
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,900
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. May I first say to my distinguished colleague, the ambassador

78
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,820
from the U.S. S.O.

79
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,740
Twelve minutes past five, the UN General Assembly in session. The speaker is President Roosevelt's

80
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,100
son. In their boxes, the interpreters, the invisible support structure of the debate,

81
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,900
whatever the language, at the UN, that's taken for granted.

82
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:04,580
The way that means worship remains equally.

83
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,860
In the subway, Herbert Friedman, a lawyer, reads his paper on his way home to suburban

84
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:16,260
Jamaica. Al Hennick works for a publisher on Fifth Avenue. He passes the time doing a

85
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,940
crossword. Marjorie O'Shaughnessy also works for a publisher, looking forward to spending

86
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,860
a quiet evening at home.

87
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,620
Steve Boatti, late, been to a movie. Bruce Singer works in Greenwich Village. Bill Palmer

88
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,780
is a student, just been playing basketball. And Hans Kramer, insurance broker. All these

89
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:45,500
people take the subway every evening. They expect to get home. They always do.

90
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:26,940
The flight manifest lists 89 passengers. The descent into Kennedy is so far uneventful.

91
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,780
It's now 15 minutes and 30 seconds past five.

92
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:52,140
With the next contraction, you'll take a deep breath and push real hard. Okay. I think

93
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:06,860
you can put it asleep now. The anesthetic being used at the time as a mixture of gases,

94
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:16,700
including one called cyclopropane. It's potentially explosive. But everybody knows that.

95
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay. It's fairly sleepy now. Okay. With the next contraction, we'll have a little bit

96
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,580
of pressure. All right. When she's starting contraction now. It's a little bit more.

97
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:38,300
Okay. Okay. Okay. We've got a baby. It's now exactly 16 minutes and 10 seconds past

98
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,300
five. One second later, several hundred miles northwest of New York City. This did what it

99
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,220
was built to do with disastrous consequences. You may have already guessed what kind of

100
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,540
technological network this is part of. It's a bit of a power station. The power station

101
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,500
known as Adam Beck to here at Niagara, where electricity is generated by the tremendous

102
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,140
power of falling water. The water turns turbine blades that make a shaft spin at the top of

103
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,340
the shaft are magnets and they spin inside a cylinder up there that has copper wire coils

104
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:22,620
on its inner wall. The interaction between the spinning magnets and the copper coils makes

105
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,980
electricity. That's where this comes in. It's a relay and its job is to detect changes in

106
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,380
power going on to a transmission line. These up here. Power flows north along these lines.

107
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,140
And on a particular evening in question, this relay detected an increase in power on one

108
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,620
of those lines that was above a preset limit. When that happened, magnets set around this

109
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:54,980
metal cup caused it to rotate and that brought this arm to make a contact like this. That

110
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,100
contact was made on the evening of November the 9th, 1965 at 16 minutes and 11 seconds

111
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,340
past five. The effect was to cascade power off the overloaded line and onto another, which

112
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,500
overloaded and tripped the next until all five lines going north had tripped out dumping their

113
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,180
entire load onto lines going south. Within seven seconds, the tremendous overload began

114
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,100
to take out generating stations all over North Eastern America from Boston to New York as the

115
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,540
network fell apart. As each area went, it overloaded the next. Within ten seconds, the only major

116
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:42,940
system left was the great energy island of New York. As the network fell apart, links

117
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,500
between one energy centre and another broke. Instead of 300,000 kilowatts coming into New

118
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,620
York to help meet demand, one and a half million kilowatts were draining out of the city to supply

119
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,500
areas now cut off from the network but still connected like leeches to the New York generators.

120
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,180
As the overload hit the New York generators, they too began to trip out.

121
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,740
Hello, little five lines. And your ducking speed is okay, your brakes are all in.

122
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,980
We're in it out. We're in it out. We've been over two right now.

123
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,140
We've had a major power here. We're in it out.

124
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,820
We're likely to main orbit on all the speed of light with the jurner humps and marine auxiliary generator.

125
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,980
As the lifeblood of the city drained, it went into spasm.

126
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,580
At the UN, chaos, the power to keep the lights on also served the interpreters.

127
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,020
Who in the growing darkness has, however, I hope, brought a glimmer of light.

128
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,660
And without interpreters trapped in their darkened boxes, deprived of access to the ears of the

129
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,980
delegate. The United Nations was suddenly and totally disunited, as completely as if at war.

130
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,980
The city's elevators stopped.

131
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,740
Perhaps the subways were the only technology that people expected to fail.

132
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,180
800,000 people were now deep in the ground under New York.

133
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,300
Caught in a technology trap, most of them had never thought twice about.

134
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,820
As light went, so did the one in Mrs. Marcanna's operating theater.

135
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,980
It was now only 10 minutes since the crisis had been triggered by the relay at Niagara,

136
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,580
more than 500 miles away.

137
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:45,780
The generators continued to trip out, and at Kennedy Airport, the radar screens went black.

138
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
And slight 911 was in trouble.

139
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,540
And all I got, flag warning, switched number two to the island.

140
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:53,860
Okay?

141
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
Kennedy, up, up.

142
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,660
Yeah, who we got? Yeah, John?

143
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,260
Can you hold it at two, 50?

144
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
I'll take 200 if I can.

145
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,900
What time do you go out?

146
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,460
A story at 2-1-3 went out. They can't hold on.

147
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,500
By 5-28, the time had come to protect the system by deliberately switching what was left off.

148
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,980
We shut down those lights and Brooklyn's challenging left going.

149
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,820
Our killer's in front of the...

150
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,860
There are gummies.

151
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,060
They're not worried about it all alone, but they're out to kill the unit.

152
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,740
We leave that in or shut it down?

153
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,180
Oh, we've got to shut it down, I guess.

154
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,940
The system operator recommends shutting down Staten Island.

155
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,620
Yeah, and I'm not worried what you'll find out, all right?

156
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,420
From all that stuff.

157
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,900
Thank you.

158
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,980
Over an area of 80 million square miles, 30 million people were now in darkness.

159
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,660
The boat was down.

160
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,380
That's right.

161
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh boy, how was this?

162
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,300
John, have a good chamois on the phone.

163
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,420
I saluted from each other in small groups.

164
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,860
Millions of people were still unaware of the extent of the blackout.

165
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,380
In the subway, especially.

166
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,340
It's not like the readings.

167
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,420
People started chatting, but for the most part, no one really got into it yet,

168
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,860
because we thought it was just another typical rush hour delay.

169
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,700
But it was dark, and that was kind of on 7 to be in such a crowd,

170
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,620
but not to be able to see anybody.

171
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,220
So one of the women had candles in her bag.

172
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,100
You know, I have some candles, and you can like them.

173
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,780
This abnormal business of actually talking to anybody on the subway,

174
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,940
caught on briefly all over New York.

175
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
Let's put some light on the situation.

176
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
My birthday anyway, anybody feel like singing?

177
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,460
No, you're a happy person.

178
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Make a happy situation, and a terrible one.

179
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,420
My name?

180
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,380
Louise?

181
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,860
Happy birthday to you.

182
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
Happy birthday to you.

183
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Happy birthday to you.

184
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,380
Happy birthday.

185
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,660
Happy birthday.

186
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,340
But while this journey had taken on a meaning,

187
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
nobody expected.

188
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,060
So too, at the hospital, had Mrs. Marcan as delivery of twins,

189
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,980
thanks to the anesthetic.

190
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,260
It was in a general story around to find flashlights,

191
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
and I immediately come on the other one,

192
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
so I see what would happen.

193
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,060
One of the nurses of course, I'll never forget,

194
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
grew up in the room carrying a light of candle.

195
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Put the candle out.

196
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Get out of here.

197
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
What's going on?

198
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Get out of here.

199
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,540
Just get out of my mind with the explosive anesthetic agent.

200
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I had visions of all of us.

201
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,780
The whole place blowing up one great conflagration.

202
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,340
No.

203
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,540
The phone system was the only thing working

204
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
if you could get a number.

205
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
No.

206
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
No.

207
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
It's a sipperto, Brian.

208
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
I can't see the runway.

209
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,540
And Captain Loster was learning the full extent of his predicament.

210
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,540
ILS, the landing aid that guided him in, wasn't there anymore.

211
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
It needs check the radio.

212
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,540
The military approach controls Canadian 911.

213
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
The ILS went US.

214
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
I've got some on.

215
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Already the guys are caked.

216
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,100
The extraordinary thing in the subways was that a full hour into the crisis nobody was

217
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
trying to escape from the trap.

218
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Yeah, it's not even a quick strip.

219
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Would it be crooked to put one in man?

220
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Yeah.

221
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Okay.

222
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Now what we need is a knife.

223
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
How are we going to?

224
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
I think I have something for it.

225
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Now you know.

226
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
We need now the cups.

227
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
We need a good cup.

228
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Got a wish.

229
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
The wishes that we get home tonight.

230
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
We need to get a little bit of the size of it.

231
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Yes, good health to the person.

232
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I'm going to get a little bit of the cup.

233
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I'm going to get a little bit of the glass.

234
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm going to get a little bit of the glass.

235
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:21,140
I just assumed that something went wrong with a particular train that I was riding on.

236
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,260
There was a feeling of it's being something we all just had to wait out together.

237
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,580
There was nothing anybody could do about it.

238
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
No one knew anything about anything.

239
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Waynecks.

240
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,060
I carry napkins around.

241
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,860
I wipe those seats off so I don't get my clothes dirty.

242
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Put your silk in this position.

243
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Oh.

244
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Do you know any different?

245
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Here they were.

246
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,260
They were going to get into a major disaster and still trying to laugh their way out of it.

247
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,020
Drink and wine in the subway outside

248
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
of that.

249
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Help yourself.

250
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
If anybody's driving don't drink.

251
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Remember that.

252
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
How about singing the song?

253
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,020
How about moving the songs?

254
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,740
I have a wet fire and a watercoat and bed.

255
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Whoa.

256
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:08,380
People began to be very jovial and began to sing.

257
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,820
Show me the way to go home and everything that people could think of that related to

258
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
our plight.

259
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,700
Let's just keep on going on.

260
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,780
At the hospital darkness made no difference.

261
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
I got the speech.

262
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
My bridge arrived.

263
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
Here we go.

264
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
All the head down.

265
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm fine.

266
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780
I'm fine.

267
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
All right.

268
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,580
Well the baby was delivered without the lights because you didn't need the lights for the

269
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
delivery.

270
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
That's manipulative.

271
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,340
Remember you're reaching up into the uterus, grabbing a foot which is strictly by feel.

272
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,140
You're up to the membranes and you bring the foot down.

273
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,140
The second baby was vigorous and we repaired the piece.

274
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
There you go.

275
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,740
You're such a pretty girl.

276
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Yes.

277
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,140
Kennedy approach the drive.

278
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,940
We're going to have your 9-11.

279
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,940
Captain Lostid had only a few seconds left to make his decision.

280
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,500
He was at 2,000 feet past the airport and heading straight for Manhattan in the darkness.

281
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:08,180
There was only one thing he could do.

282
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,340
Lostid and 200 other jets that night landed with the help of radio working on planes sitting

283
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,940
on the ground.

284
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,580
In the subway people were still coping.

285
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,540
But after an hour and a half people became very restless.

286
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,140
It was not pleasant.

287
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,180
It was not very congenial but everybody felt scared.

288
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,180
There had been this late plan you sit here and wonder and wonder and send nobody down

289
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
to help us.

290
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,980
Somebody knocked on the window and see if he would have turned to the test.

291
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,620
After about an hour and a half of these train employees would pass outside but not look

292
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,580
at us and not answer us when people banked on the windows and called out.

293
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,580
They just ignored us.

294
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,780
I think he's a conductor from the train but I'm not sure.

295
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,380
The scrunchie and the turning road.

296
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
The baby is going for help.

297
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,180
Oh, let's hold the pin.

298
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,580
Finally, people began to realise where they were.

299
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,740
Lost under the ground.

300
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
Helpless.

301
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Unless helped came.

302
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,100
When we have a major power blackout at least hits the entire city.

303
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
It's all relaxed.

304
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,180
We'll be trying to get you over as soon as possible.

305
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
I'm leaving.

306
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
It's taking you a higher action.

307
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
You would have to be in between stations.

308
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
You happen to be on a platform?

309
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,940
I don't know how long this will take.

310
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,020
It's kind of innocent and it affects the entire city.

311
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,340
We have people coming by and evacuating the trains now.

312
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,100
Please relax.

313
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,460
Mrs. McConner found out what had happened to her.

314
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
So not the way she expected.

315
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,460
Mrs. McConner, what was that?

316
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Work, work, work.

317
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,460
When I woke up and I saw all the candles lit around the room,

318
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,460
I thought I was dead and there was a priest standing nearby.

319
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,460
And for a minute there, I thought he had come to give me my last rights

320
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,460
and I was afraid that all my family knew that I was dead

321
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
and they came to light candles for me.

322
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,460
No, no, no, you're not playing more than I was playing more than that.

323
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You're most of them were at the door.

324
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Don't be frightened now.

325
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
You're going to be okay.

326
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,460
And finally, as in all good ferry stories, it was over.

327
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,460
In exactly five hours after the train stopped at 10.30,

328
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,460
the train began to empty by having all the passengers walk out

329
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,460
singly upon the catwalk.

330
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,460
A few days later, people were back at their daily routine

331
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
as if it had never happened.

332
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,460
The night New York became a trap, forgot.

333
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
I was all that really.

334
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,460
This is one of the more perfect examples of the kind of technological trap

335
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,460
that we set for ourselves, the lift, the elevator.

336
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
I mean, what is it?

337
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,460
It's a steel box, there's some buttons in it, and maybe a trap door for emergencies,

338
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
but whoever looks that close.

339
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Except when this happens, where is it?

340
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,460
And even in this situation, closed in with an escape route that we can't handle.

341
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,460
We behave like many of those New Yorkers did.

342
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,460
We strike a light, and we look around to see how badly things are.

343
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,460
And if we find, in this case, an emergency button, absolutely great.

344
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
We sit back and we wait for help to come.

345
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,460
We wait for technology to come back and save our lives,

346
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,460
because it's inconceivable that it won't, isn't it?

347
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,460
I mean, if you admit that, you've got to admit that every single day of your life,

348
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,460
in some form or other, you unconsciously walk yourself into a technology trap,

349
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,460
because that's the only way to live in the modern world.

350
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
So you don't admit it.

351
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,460
You say, oh, well, in this situation, we'll cope.

352
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,460
But what happens when the effects become widespread, irreversible, devastating?

353
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,460
What happens when, what little resources you have to help you cope?

354
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Give up. Then what?

355
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,460
Well, in all the disaster scenarios you read, what happens is that without power,

356
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
technologically-based civilization cracks up rapidly.

357
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Without enough auxiliary power, and most major cities don't have it,

358
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,460
organization is impossible. It's every man for himself, looting and arson followed.

359
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,460
And in a city not prepared to be a fortress, supplies run out fast.

360
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,460
And however frightening the thought of leaving your technological womb

361
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,460
sooner or later, there is nowhere to go but out, away from the danger.

362
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:27,460
The minute you decide to move, you're on your own, in a way that no modern 20th-century city-dweller

363
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
has ever been in his life.

364
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,460
And then the traps begin to close. To start with, do you even know where to go in order to survive?

365
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Did you manage to get a map before you left?

366
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,460
And if you did, how do you get out? Walk?

367
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Drive until you run out of fuel?

368
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Are you ahead of the millions of other people pouring down these roads trying to do?

369
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Just what you're trying to do?

370
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,460
And if they catch up with you, have you got something they need?

371
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,460
And if you have, can you protect yourself?

372
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Did you bring enough food and drink to last as long as necessary?

373
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
And if you didn't, where will you get it?

374
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Steel?

375
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,460
How far out will you have to push on until you're far enough out to be safe?

376
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,460
And can you be sure that's far enough?

377
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,460
And even if by some miracle, you finally make it.

378
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,460
Do you know enough to recognise a place to stop when you see it?

379
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,460
I mean, what does survival without technology look like?

380
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
The Beto signs up.

381
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,460
So, let's say that finally, somewhere far out into the country, you come across a place that looks right.

382
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,460
And let's say that you've had the good sense and the good luck to look for a farm.

383
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Because that's where food comes from, doesn't it?

384
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,460
OK, so it's a farm, so you decide to stop.

385
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Has anybody got there first?

386
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
Or are the owners still here?

387
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,460
Because they're going to need shelter, and people don't give their homes away.

388
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
They barricade themselves in.

389
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,460
So, sooner or later, exhausted and desperate,

390
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,460
you may have to make the decision to give up and die.

391
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Or to make somebody else give up and die, because they won't accept you in their home voluntarily.

392
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:25,460
And what in your comfortable, urban life has ever prepared you for that decision?

393
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,460
OK, let's say by some miracle the place is empty and it's all yours.

394
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Is there enough food in the house? How long will it last?

395
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
How will you cook it? Woodfires?

396
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Are you fit enough to chop all the wood you need before winter comes?

397
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,460
If you're lucky, you've got livestock on the farm. Great. Meat.

398
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,460
But can you slaughter and bleed and put your own animal?

399
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,460
OK, supposing you manage that, you've got enough meat to eat until you've eaten all the cows.

400
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
But at least you can start running your farm.

401
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,460
But it's a modern farm, remember? It's mechanized.

402
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,460
There's a gasoline pump, but it's empty.

403
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,460
So you can't use the tractor.

404
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
What you need is a horse and cart.

405
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
But when did you last see a horse and cart on a modern farm?

406
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:25,460
And everything else here, the saw, the power drills, the light, the sterilizer, the water supply, the sewage system, the hoist, the milking parlor, the pumps, and everything on this controlled panel demands the one thing you don't have.

407
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Electric power.

408
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Everything on this farm that you've found doesn't work. The place is a trap.

409
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
But there's nowhere else to go.

410
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:45,460
The only way you're going to survive is if you find the one thing you need to keep on providing the food you've got to have, and you don't need the mechanized version of that thing.

411
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,460
You need the kind people haven't used in a hundred years.

412
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Ah, you need that kind of plow. You're saved.

413
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Or are you? Because what it comes down to at this point is this. Can you use a plow?

414
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,460
It's taken a series of miracles just to get you this far, and here you are with the biggest miracle of all, a plow and animals to pull it.

415
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:13,460
So maybe after a few days of fumbling around with the harnesses and the bits and pieces, you manage to yoke up the oxen and plow the land.

416
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:21,460
And then and only then can you say that you have successfully escaped the wreckage of technological civilization and lived off the land and survived.

417
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,460
If you know how to use the furrow, you plow.

418
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,460
I mean, can you tell the difference between an ear of corn and a geranium seed?

419
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,460
Do you know when to sow whatever it is you think it is?

420
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,460
Do you know what a harvest it and eat the bit that you think isn't poisonous?

421
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:44,460
I mean, it's no accident that the chain of events triggered off by that relay and the power station back there in Niagara Falls ends here with the plow.

422
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
The relay itself doesn't matter.

423
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I mean, any one of a million things could fail and cause our complex civilization to collapse for an hour, for a day, however long, because that's when you find out the extent to which you have to be able to.

424
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,460
The extent to which you are reliant on technology and don't even know it.

425
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:15,460
That's when you see that it's so interdependent you take one thing away and the whole thing falls down and leaves you with nothing unless you can plow and survive and start the whole process off again from scratch.

426
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,460
And it's no accident that to do that you have to have a plow.

427
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:32,460
Because it was the plow that triggered everything off, a long way back in the past, after a different set of people also found out that their comfortable life was falling apart.

428
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,460
In a world where events came to a point where a fundamentally new way of life had to be found.

429
00:29:51,460 --> 00:30:00,460
That's exactly what happened about 12,000 years ago. It may be four places on the earth.

430
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,460
Northern India, Syria, Egypt, Central America.

431
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,460
It stopped raining and got very hot.

432
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:18,460
The result of that change in the weather was to lead to an invention that would trigger the development of a civilization that ends with up in the modern world.

433
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Let me explain that. You see the high grasslands started to dry out, became like this place, and the plants and the animals that had sustained the wandering tribes started to disappear.

434
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,460
People began to die. There was only one thing the survivors could do, head for water.

435
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,460
And so down they came into the great river valleys.

436
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Here in Egypt, that river was the Nile.

437
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:01,460
And the Nile was an extraordinary river. It rose in two places, for one it brought rotting vegetation and from the other potash.

438
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
And any garden will tell you what that means.

439
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,460
When it flooded every year, it dumped compost and fertilizer onto the land.

440
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,460
And the land blew too well.

441
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,460
With easy food, the population grew to where not even the Nile could support it without help.

442
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,460
Faced with starvation, the river dwellers tried planting grain by hand. Not enough.

443
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,460
What solved their problem was an invention that triggered off a series of events which ends with us in our modern technology trap.

444
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Because that invention was to trigger the beginnings of civilization.

445
00:31:46,460 --> 00:32:02,560
Sometimes

446
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:17,560
This is the first great man-made trigger of change, the plow.

447
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Because with it you know how much harvest you're going to get next year.

448
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
And because of that you know you're going to be here next year.

449
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,560
And because of that you can plan for the future.

450
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,560
And after a while when you can produce surplus food,

451
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,560
then that's when things really start to move in the tiny settlements.

452
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,560
With regular food supplies the population explodes.

453
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
The village expands.

454
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,560
There are more buildings and they're bigger for bigger families and they're more permanent.

455
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,560
You domesticate animals for their milk and their meat and their skin because they're not there to hunt anymore.

456
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,560
And basket weaving and the twisting of grass to do it teaches you how to spin flax.

457
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
And that makes linen.

458
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,560
But it's the grain that causes the fundamental change.

459
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Because with it you bake the bread that is the staple diet on which everybody lives.

460
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,560
And you learn about ovens and about the effect of heat on mud and brick.

461
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,560
But above all you have to have somewhere to store the grain surplus in pots.

462
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,560
But there's so much surplus by now you need the pots to be made faster and you need them to last longer.

463
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
So the pot has wheel happens.

464
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Then comes a problem of who does it belong to.

465
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,560
And the only answer to that is this.

466
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Writing.

467
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
And the very first writing takes that form.

468
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:51,560
A name and a symbol for what's inside this pot or a lot of pots or an entire village granary.

469
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,560
And so the little villages grew with their huts and their granaries.

470
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,560
And then almost out of nowhere it seems.

471
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
That happened.

472
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
The oldest stone building in the world.

473
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,560
The steppe pyramid of King Zozur at Sakara near Cairo.

474
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Built around 2700 BC.

475
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Instanced sophisticated architecture from mud huts in one jump.

476
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
How do they do it?

477
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Because of what they'd had to do to feed themselves.

478
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Elegant.

479
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Because the river flooded every year and destroyed landmarks and then retreated leaving the soil to dry out.

480
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
They had to do two things.

481
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Find a way of measuring the land so the farmer got his own fields back.

482
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,560
And a way of channeling the water away for use after the flood had gone.

483
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:52,560
The kind of measurement you need to do those things involves geometry and the type of mathematics a civil engineer uses.

484
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,560
And building canals teaches you to work stone.

485
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,560
If you know stone work and geometry and mathematics you can build pyramids.

486
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Especially for strong central government that was developed to run irrigation schemes in the first place tells you to.

487
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,560
If the pharaoh said he wanted a pointed stone monument that's what he got.

488
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Funny thing is the same drought that drove everybody down to the Nile also preserved the things they built like their tombs for thousands of years.

489
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,560
The stuff on the walls in this tomb for example is 4,500 years old.

490
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,560
A kind of cartoon view of the civilization the plow created.

491
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I mean look here's irrigation.

492
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
There are these people carrying water pots.

493
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
You see them?

494
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,560
And they carry them across and they pour the water into a garden that has a wall around it.

495
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,560
And then over here look there's a fellow doing a bit of weeding.

496
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
There's the plow.

497
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
They domesticated oxen.

498
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,560
They tried to domesticate any animal that they could get their hands on.

499
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I mean take a look at this.

500
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Animal flatten its back.

501
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Tights back legs.

502
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Hang onto its front legs.

503
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Stuff food down its throat and hope it'll land to love you.

504
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
You didn't get too far with that one.

505
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
It was a hyena.

506
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Well you've got a growing community and plenty of spare food and you'll need to protect yourself.

507
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
So making weapons becomes very important.

508
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,560
And here on this wall there's a whole thing about handling metals.

509
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Look here are the weights and measures people checking on how much metals going to be used.

510
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Next to them the furnace men.

511
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,560
You see the way they're raising the temperature they're blowing on these tubes to create a draft in the furnace to get the temperature high.

512
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Next to them here's the molten metal being poured into a mold.

513
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,560
And here the fella's beating it flat.

514
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Okay you get yourself a kingdom.

515
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
You get what you deserve.

516
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
You get bureaucrats.

517
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Here they are.

518
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
The scribes.

519
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Writing everything down.

520
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
See the pens behind there is?

521
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
In this case they're noting taxes.

522
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Here are the people coming in to pay their taxes.

523
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Lead persuasively by the local police.

524
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Here's a policeman with a rod of office.

525
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
More policeman.

526
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Here's an Egyptian scruff of the neck. He obviously doesn't want to pay.

527
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,560
If you end up not paying they get out their whips and they tie you to a pole.

528
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,560
And that's what you get for not coming up with the money.

529
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,560
So you have a busy sophisticated society.

530
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
You have to have people at the top in charge.

531
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
This is the tomb of one of them.

532
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
He was a kind of Egyptian choncival responsible directly to the king.

533
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
There he is.

534
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
His name was Mariruka.

535
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:16,560
By sometime around 3,200 BC the entire 700 mile length of the Nile from the Mediterranean to Aswan was united and administered by officials like Mariruka.

536
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,560
Each one running what was called a water province.

537
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,560
A section of the irrigation network and of the river under his command.

538
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,560
What held it all together was the king's magic ability as a god to come up year after year with an inundation of the Nile.

539
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,560
And to know exactly how high the waters would go.

540
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Of course it wasn't magic it was his astronomers.

541
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:51,560
They observed that one particular star, Sirius, rises just before dawn on one particular day the 17th of July every year.

542
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,560
And that day is one day before the flood begins.

543
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,560
They also saw that on average the flood itself came once every 365 days.

544
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Now you put those two facts together.

545
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
The star before dawn and the flood.

546
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
And you've got yourself a calendar.

547
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
And with a calendar you can organize people.

548
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
You can give them a date to do something on.

549
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:20,560
And as for the king's ability to predict how high the water would go well you record the level of the flood every year with a scratch on the wall.

550
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,560
And after a while your experience will tell you early on how high the water is going to be later.

551
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Now in Egypt where water is life.

552
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,560
That kind of knowledge and ability to control gives you the power to build empires.

553
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:54,560
The ancient temples of Karnak

554
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,560
On the edge of the Nile about 450 miles south of Cairo.

555
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,560
They were the center of Egyptian religion built in the imperial city of Thebes when the Egyptian empire was at its height.

556
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,840
when the Egyptian Empire was at its height,

557
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,200
the greatest power in the world.

558
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,080
This was the New York of the time.

559
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,040
The temples were built over a period of about 2,000 years,

560
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,280
each pharaoh adding his bit,

561
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,760
leaving his name in stone to last forever.

562
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,000
Inside the temple domain, there were 65 towns,

563
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,600
433 gardens and orchards,

564
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,920
400,000 animals,

565
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,080
and it took 80,000 people just to run the place.

566
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,880
Small wonder that centuries afterwards,

567
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,440
the Greeks and the Romans came here

568
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
and gored like peasants at a civilization

569
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,280
that made their efforts look like well-dressed mud huts.

570
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
It still has that effect today.

571
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,360
Here you come here from the great modern cities,

572
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,040
full of the immense power of modern technology.

573
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,520
At your fingertips, press a button, turn a switch,

574
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,840
and this place stops you dead.

575
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,880
And then, just when you think you've got the measure of Karnak,

576
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,240
you come here at dawn to the hall of columns,

577
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,080
one of the most massive structures ever built.

578
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,760
And anything I was going to say isn't enough.

579
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Look at it.

580
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:26,240
The Egyptians built an empire and ran it with a handful of technology.

581
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,720
The wheel, the irrigation canals, the loom, a calendar, pen and ink,

582
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,560
some cutting tools, simple metallurgy, and the plow,

583
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,760
the invention that triggered it all off.

584
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,880
And yet look how complex and sophisticated their civilization was

585
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,440
and how soon it happened after that first man-made harvest.

586
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
The Egyptian plow and those of the few other civilizations

587
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,280
that sprang up around the world at the same time

588
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,640
gave us control over nature,

589
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,800
and at the same time tied us for good

590
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,240
to the things that we invent so that tomorrow will be better than today.

591
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,160
The Egyptians knew that.

592
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,160
That's why they had gods, to make sure their systems didn't fail.

593
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,160
Karnak was the first great statement of what technology could do

594
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,240
with unlimited manpower and the approval of the gods.

595
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,240
CHEERING

596
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,560
Ironically, the modern equivalent lies again in the desert.

597
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,440
This time, the nomads also settled by a river, a river of oil.

598
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,120
But what it took the pharaohs four thousand years to build

599
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,760
took the Kuwaitis four thousand days.

600
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
What's happened in Kuwait, the change from a nomadic existence

601
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,720
to being able to buy and use everything modern technology has to offer,

602
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,240
has come in much less than one generation.

603
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,720
CHEERING

604
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,680
Kuwait represents the immense power of technology

605
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,080
using the way most of us have never experienced,

606
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,160
because we've lived with a kind of change it can bring for more than 100 years.

607
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,320
Here, it's been focused.

608
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,040
Change has been instant and total.

609
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,120
Hello, Nain.

610
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,880
Hello.

611
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm from the country.

612
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
You're here.

613
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,640
You're here.

614
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,000
Kuwait has suddenly become like New York,

615
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,800
or any other of the great urban islands of technology,

616
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,280
totally dependent on that technology.

617
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,840
Like them, without it, Kuwait would return to the desert.

618
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,080
Hello, Sharon?

619
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,480
Hi, how are you?

620
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,840
Hey, listen.

621
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,360
I'm coming to spend my Christmas in New York, OK?

622
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,120
You see how increasingly the only way we

623
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,960
and the advanced industrial nations with our bewildering technology network

624
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,840
can survive is by selling bewilderment and dependence on technology

625
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,240
to the rest of the world.

626
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,160
Or is it not bewilderment and dependence,

627
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,040
but a healthier, wealthier, better way of living than the old way?

628
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,520
And yet, whether or not you dress up technology to look local,

629
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,360
the technology network is the same.

630
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,120
And as it spreads, will it spread the ability to use machines

631
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,120
as we do without understanding them?

632
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Somebody said a few years ago about the way our modern world affects us all,

633
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,920
if you understand something today,

634
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,840
that means it must already be obsolete.

635
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,600
Or to put it another way,

636
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,920
never have so many people understood so little about so much.

637
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,640
So why are we in this position?

638
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,480
Why is our modern industrialized world the way it is?

639
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
And not some different way, with different technology,

640
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,440
doing different things to us.

641
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,160
Well, that's what the rest of this series is going to look at.

642
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,360
You saw just now that the plow and irrigation kicked us all off,

643
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,480
and that an invention acts rather like a trigger,

644
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,840
because once it's there, it changes the way things are,

645
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,520
and that change stimulates the production of another invention,

646
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,280
which in turn causes change, and so on.

647
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,080
Why those inventions happened between 6,000 years ago and now,

648
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,280
where they happened and when they happened,

649
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,280
is a fascinating blend of accident, genius craftsmanship,

650
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
geography, religion, war, money, ambition.

651
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Above all, at some point,

652
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,280
everybody is involved in the business of change,

653
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,280
not just the so-called great men.

654
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Given what they knew at the time,

655
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,280
and a moderate amount of what's up here,

656
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,280
I hope to show you that you or I could have done just what they did,

657
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
or come close to it,

658
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,280
because at no time did an invention come out of thin air

659
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
into somebody's head like that.

660
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
You just had to put a number of bits and pieces

661
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,280
that were already there together in the right way.

662
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Following the trail of events from some point in the past,

663
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
to a piece of modern technology,

664
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,280
is rather like a detective story with you as the detective,

665
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,280
knowing only as much as the people in the past knew,

666
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,280
and like them having to guess at what was likely to happen next.

667
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,280
So, the trigger that sets off the first of those detective stories

668
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
is to be a very good story.

669
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,280
So, the trigger that sets off the first of those detective stories

670
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
is that.

671
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,280
And I'd like to leave you with one question before next time.

672
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,280
Why does a modern invention that fundamentally affects the lives

673
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
of every single human being on this planet

674
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,280
begin 2,600 years ago with somebody doing this?
